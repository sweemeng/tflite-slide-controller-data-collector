# Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense IMU Data collector

This is code to read data from the onboard IMU. This will print data to serial in CSV form. We then copy and paste the the data to text editor to create the CSV. 

I suppose we can have a script to read from serial and save to csv. 

Original source of this is here. Except this is on platformIO
